# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE) features in the backend system that creates and manages solution outline documents using LLM assistance. The current system uses FastAPI to expose endpoints, and the goal is to enhance it with real-time streaming capabilities through SSE to improve the user experience when interacting with LLM-generated content. Additionally, the project structure will be optimized to better support this new functionality and several new features will be added, including versioned solution outlines, Architecture Decision Records (ADR), enhanced project models, and team/task management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: SSE Implementation for LLM Responses

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see LLM-generated content appear in real-time as it's being generated, so that I can start reading and processing information without waiting for the complete response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests LLM-generated content THEN the system SHALL establish an SSE connection to stream the response.
2. WHEN the LLM is generating content THEN the system SHALL stream each chunk of text as it becomes available.
3. WHEN the LLM completes content generation THEN the system SHALL properly close the SSE connection.
4. IF the connection is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection attempts gracefully.
5. WHEN streaming LLM content THEN the system SHALL maintain proper formatting and structure of the content.

### Requirement 2: Project Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured project organization, so that the codebase is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL follow a domain-driven design approach.
2. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns.
3. WHEN adding SSE functionality THEN the system SHALL integrate it without disrupting existing functionality.
4. WHEN structuring the project THEN the system SHALL group related functionality together.
5. WHEN implementing services THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection for better testability.

### Requirement 3: SSE Event Types and Handlers

**User Story:** As a user, I want different types of real-time updates for various LLM operations, so that I can have a more interactive and responsive experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LLM is processing a request THEN the system SHALL send status update events.
2. WHEN the LLM encounters an error THEN the system SHALL send error events with appropriate details.
3. WHEN the LLM provides intermediate results THEN the system SHALL send partial content events.
4. WHEN the system needs to send different event types THEN the system SHALL use appropriate event identifiers.
5. WHEN streaming events THEN the system SHALL include relevant metadata with each event.

### Requirement 4: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SSE implementation to be resource-efficient, so that the system can handle multiple concurrent streaming connections without degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple clients connect for SSE streams THEN the system SHALL maintain performance stability.
2. WHEN an SSE connection is idle for a specified period THEN the system SHALL properly terminate the connection.
3. WHEN implementing SSE THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous processing to prevent blocking.
4. WHEN streaming large responses THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate buffering strategies.
5. WHEN handling concurrent SSE connections THEN the system SHALL limit resource usage per connection.

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing LLM Client

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless integration between the SSE functionality and the existing Ollama client, so that streaming works with the current LLM implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Ollama client generates content THEN the system SHALL properly capture streaming output.
2. WHEN implementing SSE THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing Ollama client methods.
3. WHEN the Ollama client is updated THEN the system SHALL adapt the SSE implementation accordingly.
4. WHEN streaming from the Ollama client THEN the system SHALL preserve all metadata and formatting.
5. IF the Ollama client connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the failure in the SSE stream.

### Requirement 6: Solution Outline Versioning

**User Story:** As a user, I want solution outlines to be versioned each time I save them, so that I can track changes over time and compare different versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a solution outline for a project THEN the system SHALL generate a new version.
2. WHEN a user requests a solution outline THEN the system SHALL return the highest (most recent) version by default.
3. WHEN storing solution outlines THEN the system SHALL maintain the version property for each document.
4. WHEN implementing versioning THEN the system SHALL ensure data integrity across versions.
5. WHEN designing the database schema THEN the system SHALL support efficient retrieval of specific versions.

### Requirement 7: Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), so that I can document important architectural decisions affecting the project and include them in the solution outline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an ADR THEN the system SHALL store it with appropriate metadata.
2. WHEN a user requests to include ADRs in a solution outline THEN the system SHALL incorporate them properly.
3. WHEN implementing ADR functionality THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for managing ADRs.
4. WHEN storing ADRs THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships with their associated projects.
5. WHEN retrieving solution outlines THEN the system SHALL include relevant ADRs when requested.

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Project Model

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced project models with code properties and state tracking, so that I can better manage project lifecycle and implementation details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating or updating a project THEN the system SHALL support a code property field.
